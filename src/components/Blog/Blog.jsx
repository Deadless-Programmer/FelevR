                  and controlled components refer to different parts of an
                  experiment or system. Uncontrolled components are elements
                  that are not manipulated or regulated by the experimenter and
                  are allowed to vary naturally or due to external factors.{" "}
                  <br /> <span className="font-semibold">Controlled</span>{" "}
                  components, on the other hand, are deliberately manipulated or
                  regulated by the experimenter to achieve a desired outcome or
                  to isolate specific variables. For example, in a plant growth
                  experiment, the amount of sunlight and rainfall would be
                  uncontrolled components as they are not manipulated by the
                  experimenter, while the amount of fertilizer and water
                  provided to each plant would be controlled components as they
                  are regulated by the experimenter.

                How to validate React props using PropTypes?

              <div className="px-4 pb-4">
                <p>
                  To validate React props using PropTypes, you can import the
                  PropTypes library from the 'prop-types' package, and then
                  define the expected type for each prop within the component's
                  propTypes object. This allows you to catch and flag any errors
                  or incorrect data types passed to the component via its props.
                  For example, PropTypes.string will expect a string type, while
                  PropTypes.number will expect a number type. It is considered a
                  best practice to validate your component props using PropTypes
                  to ensure your code runs smoothly and without unexpected
                  errors.

                  Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that allows

                  server-side. Express.js, on the other hand, is a web
                  application framework built on top of Node.js. It provides a
                  set of features and functionalities to make it easier to build
                  web applications using Node.js. It provides an abstraction
